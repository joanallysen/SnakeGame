# Snake Game in C++ (Console-based) üêç

A simple yet fun **Snake Game** built using C++ for the console. This game allows both **single-player** and **multiplayer** modes, where two players can play on the same screen using different controls. Think like playing the flashgame fireboy and watergirl, although controls are different.

## Features

- **Single-player mode**: Classic Snake gameplay where the player controls a snake and eats food to grow longer.
- **Multiplayer mode**: Two players can play simultaneously on the same screen, each controlling a separate snake, trying to defeat the other snake by trapping them!
- **Settings menu**: Customize game options like screen size, speed, and wall border size.
- **Continuous growth**: Custom mode such as tail growing continuously after some time without eating the fruit, adding to the challenge.
- **Customizable game rules**: You can turn on/off death upon hitting the wall, change the snake's speed, or adjust the size of the game panel.

## Gameplay

### Controls:
- **Player 1** (Snake 1):
  - `W` - Move Up
  - `A` - Move Left
  - `S` - Move Down
  - `D` - Move Right
  - `X` - Quit Game
  
- **Player 2** (Snake 2 - Multiplayer only):
  - `I` - Move Up
  - `J` - Move Left
  - `K` - Move Down
  - `L` - Move Right

Unfortunately due to current input delay, the original input for player 2 using the arrow key is momentarily replaced with 'I' 'J' 'K' 'L'.

### General Objective:
- Eat the food (`#`) to grow longer.
- Avoid running into walls or your own tail (depending on the settings).
- In multiplayer, try to avoid hitting the other player's tail or hit the wall!

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: On launching, you will be presented with a **main menu** where you can choose to play **Single-player** or **Multiplayer**.
   
2. **Settings**: You can adjust game settings, including screen size, snake speed, and whether you die when hitting the wall.

3. **Gameplay**: Use the controls to guide your snake to eat food and grow. In multiplayer mode, each player will control their own snake with different keys.

4. **End Game**: The game ends when a player hits a wall or their own tail (or the opponent‚Äôs tail in multiplayer).

5. **Play Again**: After a game ends, you'll be given an option to play again.

## Settings Menu

You can modify these game settings:

1. **Game Panel Size**: Adjust the width and height of the game board (keep in mind, larger sizes might cause screen issues).
2. **Snake Speed**: Set how fast the snake moves.
3. **Death on Wall**: Enable or disable dying when hitting a wall.
4. **Tail Growth**: Enable or disable continuous tail growth over time (only in multiplayer).

## Game Rules

- **Wall Collision**: If enabled, hitting the wall results in a game over for the player.
- **Tail Collision**: Colliding with your own or the opponent‚Äôs tail will result in a game over.
- **Fruit**: The fruit appears randomly on the board. Eating it will increase your score and the length of your snake.
