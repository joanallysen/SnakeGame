Hello 

This is a remake of the snake game using c++ in the console with multiplayer functionality

To try playing, just download the raw file and run it with Visual Studio Code (with gcc compiler) or any online c++ compiler

Fell free to modify or fix the code!


**Note : The control for player 1 is WASD, player 2 is IJKL**

I have modified the logic mainly the datatype from int to a vector, So instead of moving the tail 1 by 1 using a for loop, I inserted a new head and remove the last tail. In the drawPanel() this will automatically adjust with the snake head and tails position.

the game logic is inspired from geeksforgeeks and can be seen below.

# ISSUES
Arrow key control is temporarily changed to I J K L control because of delay.
