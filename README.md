Hello 

This is a remake of the snake game using c++ in the console with multiplayer functionality
*Note* The control for player 1 is WASD, player 2 is IJKL

I have modified the logic mainly the datatype from int to a vector.

the game logic is inspired from geeksforgeeks and can be seen below.

# ISSUES
Arrow key control is temporrily changed to I J K L control because of delay.
